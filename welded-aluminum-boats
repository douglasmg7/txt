Forced through a shaped

# MIG
Metal inert gas

# TIG
Tungsten inert gas
TIG welding on the other hand is more commonly used for your thinner gauge materials. Items that are made with this process are things like kitchen sinks and tool boxes. The biggest benefit is that you can get your power down really low and not blow through the metal
The most versatile machine is the TIG welder as you can weld many different types of metals

# HAZ
Heat Affected Zone

# 5000 and 6000 aluminum alloy series
Good weld characteristics
Good corrosion resistance to salt water
Once welded, both alloy series do lose some strength in the weld zones

# Fair
Pleasing curves

# Hogged
Unpleasing curves

# NC service
Cut service

# Flam
Combination of a cone and cylinder which can be formed of developable surfaces without any roll forming or stretch forming

# Flair
Requires the metal to be shaped in two different directions
Shape that requires forming and in most cases would also require planking or piecing the surface together from multiple formed pieces of plate or sheet
