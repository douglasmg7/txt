# Update refs from origin, but do not merge.
git fetch
# git fetch shows which refs where updated. It will show something like:
# a8e5e4e..295bf31  master     -> origin/master
# This means the last time you fetched master it was at a8e5e4e now it is at 295bf31. You can see the changed files with something like:
git diff --name-status a8e5e4e..295bf31
git diff master...origin/master
git diff --stat master...origin/master
git diff --name-only master...origin/master
