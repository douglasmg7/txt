Once a Shape is created, it can be used and modified by all workbenches by creating scripted objects around that Shape.
Essentially, every object derived from a Part Feature (Part::Feature class) is expected to hold and manipulate a Shape.

## BREP
In solid modeling and computer-aided design, boundary representation—often abbreviated as B-rep or BREP—is a method for representing shapes using the limits. 
A solid is represented as a collection of connected surface elements, which define the boundary between interior and exterior points.
Compared to the constructive solid geometry (CSG) representation, which uses only primitive objects and Boolean operations to combine them, boundary representation is more flexible and has a much richer operation set. In addition to the Boolean operations, B-rep has extrusion (or sweeping), chamfer, blending, drafting, shelling, tweaking and other operations which make use of these.
