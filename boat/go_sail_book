Points of sailing
  Close hauled
    Sails need to be pulled in tight
  Close reach
    Let the sails out a little bit
  Beam reach
    This is the fastest and easiest point of sailing
    Let the sails out half way
  Broad reach
    Let the sails out a bit more
  Training run
    This keeps the wind slightly to on side of the stern which is easier to steer than a dead run
  Run
    This brings the wind behind you, so the sails could be either side and all the way out
