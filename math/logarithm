# Logarithm base 2, How many 2s do we need to multiply to get 8.
log2(8) = 3
2^3 = 8

# Common logarithm, base 10.
log(8)
log10(8)

# Natural logarithm, base 2.718281828459045 (Euler's number).
ln(8)

# Base change formula.
loga(x) = log10(x) / log10(10)

# Change exponent formula.
log(x^a) = a*log(x)

# Multiply and division formula.
log(a) + log(b) = log(a * b)
log(a) - log(b) = log(a / b)
