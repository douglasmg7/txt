# systemctl - Control the systemd system and service manager

# Config files:
  /lib/systemd/system/
    # This will be the generic, vanilla unit file, often written by the upstream project's maintainers that should work on any system that deploys systemd in its standard implementation.
    # You should not edit files in this directory.
    # Instead you should override the file, if necessary, using another unit file location which will supersede the file in this location. 
  
  /usr/lib/systemd/system/
    # Where pacman puts package scripts.

  /usr/lib/systemd/system/
  /usr/lib/systemd/system/user
    # Where i am puting my services. 
    
  /etc/systemd/system/
    # If you wish to modify the way that a unit functions, the best location to do.
    # Unit files found in this directory location take precedence over any of the other locations on the filesystem.
  
  /run/systemd/system
    # Location for run-time unit definitions.
    # Unit files found in this directory have a priority landing between those in /etc/systemd/system and /lib/systemd/system.
    # This directory can be used to change the system's unit behavior for the duration of the session.
    # All changes made in this directory will be lost when the server is rebooted.
