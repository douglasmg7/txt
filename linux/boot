### Linux system boot using Sys V init ###

# When a Linux computer is started, the processor searches for the BIOS on the system memory.

# BIOS then tests system resources and find the first boot device, usually set as hard disk, it looks for Master Boot Record (MBR) on the hard disk, loads its contents to memory and passes control to it, the further boot process is controlled by MBR.

# Master Boot Record initiates the Boot loader (Linux has two well know boot loaders, GRUB and LILO, 80% of Linux systems are using GRUB loaders).

# GRUB or LILO loads the kernel module.

# Kernel module immediately looks for the “init” in /sbin partition and executes it. Init is a symlink for a programa (Sys V init, systemd or other init system).

# The very first file read by init is /etc/inittab, from here init decides the run level of our Linux operating system.

# It finds partition table information from /etc/fstab file and mounts partitions accordingly.

# Init then launches all the services/scripts specified in the /etc/init.d directory of the default run level.
# This is the step where all services are initialized by init one by one.
# In this process, one service at a time is started by init, all services/daemons run in the background and init keeps managing them.

# The shutdown process works in pretty much the reverse function, first of all init stops all services and then filesystem is un-mounted at the last stage.

# The well know replacements for this init based system as Upstart , Epoch , Mudar  and Systemd.
# Systemd is the one which got most attention and is considered to be better of all available alternatives.
