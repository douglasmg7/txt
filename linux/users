    account is the user name. This field can not be blank. Standard *NIX naming rules apply.
    password is the user password.
    UID is the numerical user ID. In Arch, the first login name (after root) is UID 1000 by default; subsequent UID entries for users should be greater than 1000.
    GID is the numerical primary group ID for the user. Numeric values for GIDs are listed in /etc/group.
    GECOS is an optional field used for informational purposes; usually it contains the full user name, but it can also be used by services such as finger and managed with the chfn command. This field is optional and may be left blank.
