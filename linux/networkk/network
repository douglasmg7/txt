WPA supplicant
  Is a cross-platform supplicant with support for WEP, WPA and WPA2 (IEEE 802.11i / RSN (Robust Secure Network)). It is suitable for desktops, laptops and embedded systems and works with both WEXT and nl80211.

iw
  Only supports the nl80211 (netlink) standard. It does not support the older WEXT (Wireless EXTentions) standard. If iw does not see your card, this may be the reason.
