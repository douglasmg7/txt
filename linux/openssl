openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 356
  req - utility used to request the certificate.
  -x509 - tells the computer we want a self signed certificate and not to actually request one from a certificate authority.
  -newkey - takes a paramater rsa:n-bits. It will generate a new key and certificate with RSA encryption of n-bits that are passed in. Here we are passing in the request for RSA of 2048 bits.
  -keyout key.pem - puts out a key file that is the same name as the argument being passed to -keyout. In this case, we are generating a key file named key.pem.
  -out cert.pem - puts out a file (in this case a certificate) with the name being passed to -out. Here we are certificate cert.pem.
  -days XXX - how many days the certificate should be for. Defaults to 30 days.
