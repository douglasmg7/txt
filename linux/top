# top - display Linux processes

-b  :Batch-mode operation.
    Starts top in Batch mode, which could be useful for sending output from top to other programs or to a file.
    In this mode, top will not accept input  and runs until the iterations limit you've set with the `-n' command-line option or until killed.

-d  :Delay-time interval as:  -d ss.t (secs.tenths)
    Specifies the delay between screen updates, and overrides the corresponding value in one's personal configuration file or  the  startup  default.   Later
    this can be changed with the `d' or `s' interactive commands.

-d  : Number of iterations.

# List grep process.
top -d 2 -b -n 3 | grep python
