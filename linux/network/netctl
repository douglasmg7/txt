# systemctl enable netctl-ifplugd@interface.service
# DHCP profiles will be started/stopped when the network cable is plugged in/unplugged.
# The netctl-ifplugd@interface.service will prefer profiles that use DHCP.
# To automatically start a static IP profile the option ExcludeAuto=no needs to be set in it.
# To prioritize a profile with a static IP over DHCP profiles, you can set Priority=2, which is higher than the default priority given to DHCP profiles of Priority=1.
pacman -S ifplugd
systemctl enable netctl-ifplugd@wlan0.service

# system enable netctl-auto@interface.service
# netctl profiles will be started/stopped automatically as you move from the range of one network into the range of another network (roaming).
# Profiles must use Security=wpa-configsection or Security=wpa to work with netctl-auto rather than Security=wpa-config.
# If you want some wireless profile not to be started automatically by netctl-auto@interface.service, you have to explicitly add ExcludeAuto=yes to that profile.
# You can use priority= in the WPAConfigSection (see /etc/netctl/examples/wireless-wpa-configsection) to set priority of a profile when multiple wireless access points are available.
# Note that interface is not literal, but to be substituted by the name of your device's interface, e.g. netctl-auto@wlp4s0.service. See netctl.profile(5) for details.
