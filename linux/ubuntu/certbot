- Congratulations! Your certificate and chain have been saved at:
  /etc/letsencrypt/live/www.zunka.com.br/fullchain.pem
  Your key file has been saved at:
  /etc/letsencrypt/live/www.zunka.com.br/privkey.pem
  Your cert will expire on 2018-11-29. To obtain a new or tweaked
  version of this certificate in the future, simply run certbot-auto
  again with the "certonly" option. To non-interactively renew *all*
  of your certificates, run "certbot-auto renew"
- Your account credentials have been saved in your Certbot
  configuration directory at /etc/letsencrypt. You should make a
  secure backup of this folder now. This configuration directory will
  also contain certificates and private keys obtained by Certbot so
  making regular backups of this folder is ideal.
