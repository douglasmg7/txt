To background a currently running process
    If you have already started the process in the foreground, but you want to move it to the background, you can do the following:

    Press Ctrl+z to put the current process to sleep and return to your shell. (This process will be paused until you send it another signal.)
    Run the bg command to resume the process, but have it run in the background instead of the foreground.


Run script in the same process.
. ./script.sh
