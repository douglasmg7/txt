# Bourne Again Shell - bash

# process
# When you "run" or "execute" a program, your kernel loads its pre-written instructions (its code) by creating a process for your program to work in.
# Your program can run many times simultaneously, each of those instances are running processes of your program.
# A process also has a few hooks to the outside world via something called file descriptors.
# These are essentially plugs we use to connect processes to files, devices or other processes.
# File descriptors are identified by numbers, though the first three also have standard names:
# 	standard input
# 		File descriptor 0
# 	standard output
# 		File descriptor 1
# 	standard error
# 		File descriptor 2

# run a bash script
chmod + script.txt
bash script.txt
./script.txt

# which shell
echo $SHELL

# /bin/usr/env
# It's a program that can find and start other programs

# hashbang - shebang
# it is important to use, for compatibility
#!/usr/bin/env bash
#!/bin/env bash

# how long take to run the command
time ls

# conncect fd1 and fd2 from cmd_a to cmd_b
cmd_a |& cmd_b

# control operator
cmd_a; cmd_b	# start a new line, run the command and wait for it to end before advancing to the next command in the list 
cmd_a || cmd_b	# run the command before it as it normally would, but after finishing that command move to the next command only if the command before it failed

# bash commands
	# functions - are previously declared blocks of commands that were given a name
	# builtin - are tiny procedures built into bash
	# program - also called an external command (ls, sort, etc...)

# show where bash find the program
type ping
type echo

# including home directory into path
PATH=$PATH:~

# bash version
echo $BASH_VERSION
bash --version

# make characters literal
""	- # for any argument that contains expansions (such as $variable or $(command) expansions)
''  - # for any other arguments - single quotes make sure that everything in the quotes remains literal
\	  - # in front of the character that we want to make literal

# avoid mistakes with commands without quoting
a=' log'
rm /home/$a 		# mistake - remove /home/ and log
rm "/home/$a" 	# error message - try to remove '/home/ log'

# empty device
# files that represent devices in our system
# we're communicating directly with those devices through the kernel
# null device is a special device that is always empty
# anything you write to it will be lost and nothing can be read from it
/dev/null

Hello world.
Since I started learning bash, you suddenly seem so much bigger than you were before.

# redirect bash fd
# used to change the file descriptors of bash itself (rather than those of a new command)
# bash will create a new file descriptor ("plug") for you with that number
