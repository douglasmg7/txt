# Computer vision algorithms


## Detection
Scale up Haar-like feature instead scale up image.

### Viola-jonew
It is square region that scan the image, looking for complete face with eyes nose and mounth.

### Haar-like Features
Edge Features
Line Features
Four-rectangle Features

### Integral Image
It's the replacement of each pixel point with the sum of left top values.
Using integral we can find a rectangle sum with two sums and two subtractions.


## Training
Scale image down to 24px by 24px, to reduce the computational effort.
Need supply images with faces and with no faces to training the algorithm.
