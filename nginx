# nginx (pronounced "engine X"), is a free, open-source, high-performance HTTP server and reverse proxy, as well as an IMAP/POP3 proxy server, written by Igor Sysoev in 2005. nginx is well known for its stability, rich feature set, simple configuration, and low resource consumption.

# Install.
$ sudo pacman -S nginx

# Check if service is running.
$ systemctl status nginx

# If not running.
$ sudo systemctl start nginx

# To start on start-up system.
$ sudo system enable nginx

# Confirm if nginx is running.
http://127.0.0.1/

# To stop your web server.
$ sudo systemctl stop nginx

# To start the web server when it is stopped.
$ sudo systemctl start nginx

# To stop and then start the service again.
$ sudo systemctl restart nginx

# If you are simply making configuration changes, Nginx can often reload without dropping connections.
$ sudo systemctl reload nginx

# By default, Nginx is configured to start automatically when the server boots. If this is not what you want, you can disable this behavior.
$ sudo systemctl disable nginx

# To re-enable the service to start up at boot.
$ sudo systemctl enable nginx

# The Nginx configuration directory. All of the Nginx configuration files reside here.
"/etc/nginx"

# The main Nginx configuration file. This can be modified to make changes to the Nginx global configuration.
"/etc/nginx/nginx.conf" 

# The directory where per-site "server blocks" can be stored. Nginx will not use the configuration files found in this directory unless they are linked to the sites-enabled directory (see below). Typically, all server block configuration is done in this directory, and then enabled by linking to the other directory.
"/etc/nginx/sites-available/" 

# The directory where enabled per-site "server blocks" are stored. Typically, these are created by linking to configuration files found in the sites-available directory.
"/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/"

# This directory contains configuration fragments that can be included elsewhere in the Nginx configuration. Potentially repeatable configuration segments are good candidates for refactoring into snippets.
"/etc/nginx/snippets"

# Every request to your web server is recorded in this log file unless Nginx is configured to do otherwise.
"/var/log/nginx/access.log" 

# Any Nginx errors will be recorded in this log.
"/var/log/nginx/error.log" 

# Change the entire directory where nginx will server files.
$ chmod -R 755 <dir>

# Change permission for files.
$ chmod 644 <file>

# Identify nginx user.
$ ps -ef | grep nginx
