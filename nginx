# nginx (pronounced "engine X"), is a free, open-source, high-performance HTTP server and reverse proxy, as well as an IMAP/POP3 proxy server, written by Igor Sysoev in 2005. nginx is well known for its stability, rich feature set, simple configuration, and low resource consumption.

# Install.
$ sudo pacman -S nginx

# Check if service is running.
$ systemctl status nginx

# If not running.
$ systemctl start nginx

# Confirm if nginx is running.
http://127.0.0.1/

# To stop your web server.
$ sudo systemctl stop nginx

# To start the web server when it is stopped.
$ sudo systemctl start nginx

# To stop and then start the service again.
$ sudo systemctl restart nginx

# If you are simply making configuration changes, Nginx can often reload without dropping connections.
$ sudo systemctl reload nginx

# By default, Nginx is configured to start automatically when the server boots. If this is not what you want, you can disable this behavior.
$ sudo systemctl disable nginx

# To re-enable the service to start up at boot.
