network part
subnet part
host part

All that a subnet mask does is indicate how many bits are being “borrowed” from the host component of an IP address.

Class A
0 - 126
network.host.host.host

Class B
128 - 191
network.network.host.host

Class C
192 - 223
network.network.network.host

Class D
224 - 239
not defined

Class E
240 - 255
not defined

The following blocks of IP addresses are allocated for private networks:

    10.0.0.0/8  (10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255)
    172.16.0.0/12  (172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255)
    192.168.0.0/16  (192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255)
    169.254.0.0/16  (169.254.0.0 to 169.254.255.255)*

*Note that 169.254.0.0/16 is a block of private IP addresses used for random self IP assignment where DHCP servers are not available.
