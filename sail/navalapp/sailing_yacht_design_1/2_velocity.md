# Velocity
The speed at which a craft is able to navigate

Linked to three characteristics of the yacht:
    Lwl
    SA
    Displacement

## System of waves
Linked to shape of hull (very complex matter)
Approximated by the sum of two independnt system of waves generated
    At the bow
    At the stern
The generation of waves implies an energy consumption
Rw - Resistance due to wave formation
    Increases as the amplitude of the system of waves increase
    As the boat increase her speed, the wavelength of the generated waves also increases
Whenever the length at the waterline is equal to an intire multiple of the wavelength, one has a hump or a maximum of the resistance due to waves.
When the length at the waterline equals an entire odd multiple of the wavelength divided by two, one has a hallow or a minimum of the resistance due to waves.
