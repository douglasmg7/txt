### Silica colloidal (Cab-O-Sil) (Aerosil)
Structural 
Carbosil
AEROSILÂ® 200 is a brand of fumed silica which is marketed for many uses.
Although wood flour is not as strong as silica, the joint is usually stronger than the surrounding wood and the slightly weakened joint has no effect on the strength of the construction. Mixtures of epoxy with less strong fillers such as microspheres are not strong and should not be used in structural applications. They are great for fairing.

### Micro Spheres (micro balloons)
Non-structural
Are microscopic hollow sphere used as an additive to many materials to modify the characteristics. In boatbuilding it is a thickener in epoxy mixtures particularly useful as a fairing compound.

### Cell-O-Fill
Structural 
Derived from all-natural alpha cellulose, the fibrous ribbons create a structural matrix when mixed with epoxy for use in structural joinery.  Used in place of colloidal silica (such as Cab-o-sil), it will not billow in the air like silica, and you will need half as much to create the same consistency.  There are no health hazards associated with Cell-O-Fill and International standards consider it only a "nuisance dust."  Cell-o-fill is included in most of the CLC epoxy kits.
