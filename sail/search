Going a stage further, I read that the Pardeys in their book "Cruising in Serrafyn" didn't have epoxies but applied three coats of creosote to their finished hull before painting. I assume they did this to protect against marine wood borers but there must have been some protection against rot also gained through this process. Could creosote be compatible with epoxy and with cascamite?
