SOG - Speed Over Ground

VMG - Velocity Made Good
    Indicating the speed of a sailboat towards (or from) the direction of the wind

VMC - Velocity Made good on Course
    The speed component in the direction of a mark
    VMC =  SOG * cos(Course deviation)
    If a mark is exactly currently in the direction of the wind, VMC will be the same as VMG
