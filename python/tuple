# Create a tuple.
t = (3, 4, 6)
t = (3,)

# Creatte a tuple from a string.
t = tuple('asdf')


# Why Python is Great: Namedtuples
# Using namedtuple is way shorter than
# defining a class manually:
>>> from collections import namedtuple
>>> Car = namedtuple('Car', 'color mileage')

# Our new "Car" class works as expected:
>>> my_car = Car('red', 3812.4)
>>> my_car.color
'red'
>>> my_car.mileage
3812.4

# We get a nice string repr for free:
>>> my_car
Car(color='red' , mileage=3812.4)

# Like tuples, namedtuples are immutable:
>>> my_car.color = 'blue'
