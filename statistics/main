#Statistics
We use statistics to distill and communicate relevant fea‐
tures of our data.

# Mean
Mean (or average), which is just the sum of the data divided by its count:

# Median and Quantile
A generalization of the median is the quantile, which represents the value under
which a certain percentile of the data lies (the median represents the value under
which 50% of the data lies):

# Mode
Less commonly you might want to look at the mode, or most common value(s)

# Dispersion
Dispersion refers to measures of how spread out our data is. Typically they’re statistics
for which values near zero signify not spread out at all and for which large values
(whatever that means) signify very spread out. For instance, a very simple measure is
the range, which is just the difference between the largest and smallest elements:

# Variance

# Standart deviation
math.sqrt(variance(xs))
