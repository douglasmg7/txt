Justin's Top 10 Practice Tips
1. Practice what you can't do, not what you can.
2. Never practice making a mistake. Get it right.
3. Start slowly and get it right before you speed up.
4. Using a timer saves time.
5. Focus on one element of practice at a time.
6. Try and practice a little every day, rather than practising a lot all on one day..
7. Keep track of your practice: use a practice schedule..
8. If it sounds good, it is good!
9. Playing and Practicing are very different, don't confuse them.
10. The more you think, the more you stink! Practice until it becomes instinctive.

Using a mirror
If you have a bit of a belly, or find yourself straining your neck to see the fingerboard, you might consider using a mirror. I used my dad's shaving mirror when I first practised pretty much all of the time, so I could check the position of my fretting hand, but having a big mirror so you can see both hands and your posture is ideal.
