Arrays are fixed-length sequences of items of the same type. Arrays in Go can be created using the following syntaxes:
[N]Type
[N]Type{value1, value2, ..., valueN}
[...]Type{value1, value2, ..., valueN}

Slices can be created using the following syntaxes:
make([]Type, length, capacity)
make([]Type, length)
[]Type{}
[]Type{value1, value2, ..., valueN}

Overall, slices are cleaner, more flexible, and less bug-prone than arrays, so you should prefer using them over arrays whenever possible.
