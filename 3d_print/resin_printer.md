# Resin 3d printer

## SLA or SL (stereolithography apparatus)
Laser(uv) cures resin point by point.
Layer thickness: 25-200 microns.
Slower than onthers.
Minimum laser spot size.
Uses a UV laser to draw rounded lines.

## DLP (Digital light projector)
Projector cures entire resin layer at once.
Layer thickness: 5-150 microns.
Vary fast print.
Low maintenance.
Minimum pixel size.
Uses a projector screen to project layers of squared voxels.

## MSLA (Masked SLA)
Uses an LED array as it's light source together with an LCD photomask in order to shape the light image from the LED array.
High resolution with fine detail.
Panel lifespan: 400hours on average (consumable).
Resolution mask from LCD(2k or 4k) define the print resolution.

## Resin

### Standard resin

#### Pros
Fine features & high detail
Smooth surface finish
Very inexpensive SLA material

#### Cons
Brittle (can shatter)
Low impact strength
Low heat deflection temperature



### Clear resin

#### Pros
Fine features & high detail
Smooth surface finish
Transparent
During post-processing it can be made as transparent as glass

#### Cons
Brittle (can shatter)
Low impact strength
Clear finish can clout over time due to sunlight



### Tough resin (Engineering resin)

#### Pros
High stiffness
Very Durable

#### Cons
Not good for parts with thin walls
Relatively brittle
If have a good wall thickness will not be so brittle



### Heat resistant resin

#### Pros
High heat deflection temperature
Smooth surface finish

#### Cons
Brittle
Not good for parts with thin walls



### Flexible resin

#### Pros
High flexibility
Low hardness
High impact resistance

#### Cons
Require extensive support structures
Materials break down over time



### Casting resin

#### Pros
Low ash content after burnout
Fine features and high detail
High impact resistance

#### Cons
Low impact and wear resistance
