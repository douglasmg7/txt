In my eyes
Indisposed
In disguise
As no one knows
Hides the face
Lies the snake
The sun
In my disgrace
Boiling heat
Summer stanch
'Neath the black
The sky looks dead
Call my name
Through the dream
And I'll hear you
Scream again

(Chorus)
Black hole sun
Won't you come
And wash away the rain
Black hole sun
Won't you come
Won't you come
Won't you come

Stuttering
Cold and damp
Steal the warm wind
Tired friend
Times are gone
For honest men
And sometimes Far too long
For snakes
In my shoes
Walking sleep
And my youth
I pray to keep
Heaven send
Hell away
No one sings
Like you
Anymore

Chorus x2
Won't you come (Black hole sun, black hole sun) x4

Hang my head
Drown my fear
Till you all just
Disappear

Chorus x3

Won't u come (Black hole sun, Black hole sun) x7
