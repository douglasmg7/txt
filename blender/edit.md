# Edit

## Use inset instead extrude and scale to keep proporitons:
i, to inset and keep same distance from out borders.
e, s, to extrude and keep the inner into same scale.
i, i, inset individual.

## Inset have a option "offset even"
For cube use offset even on for precision modeling.
For circle use offset even off for precision modeling.

## Dissolve edges
Ctrl + x
Ctrl + delete

## Merge vertex
m
Mesh > Merge

## Vertex > Rip vertices (mouse position define wich side will be moved)
v

## Vertex > Rip vertices and fill
Alt v (fills the gap)

## Vertex > Rip vertices and extend
Alt d

## Mesh > Split > Selection
y

## Slide edge
gg or shift, v
e to match the shap of the adjacent vertices.
f ?
c go outside the mesh.

## Slide vertex
shift, v

## Slide face
shift, v
