# Snap 
# Is a software deployment and package management system. The packages are called 'snaps' and the tool for using them is 'snapd', which works across a range of Linux distributions and allows, therefore, distro-agnostic upstream software deployment. Snap was originally designed and built by Canonical.

# Install snap
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/snapd.git
cd snapd
makepkg -si
sudo systemctl enable --now snapd.socket
sudo ln -s /var/lib/snapd/snap /snap
# Test

hello-world
