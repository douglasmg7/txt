MCU (Microcontroller Unit)
MPU (Microprocessor)
CPU (Central Processing Unit)
IC (Integrated chip)
SoC (System-on-a-Chip)
DSP (Digital Signal Processor)

MCU (microcontroller unit) can be viewed as a single-chip computer,
whereas an MPU (microprocessor) has surrounding chips that support various functions like memory, interfaces, and I/O.

Soc (System-on-a-Chip), which is an entire system on a single integrated chip (IC).
An SoC can be based on an MCU or MPU and will provide everything that’s necessary to perform certain types of applications.

It’s getting harder to tell if a device is an MCU or an MPU because MCUs can do so much these days, including more sophisticated peripherals.
The difference between MCUs and MPUs is becoming less pronounced since some MCUs now come with simple software drivers for more sophisticated peripherals and more MPUs can be found that have integrated peripherals on-chip.
