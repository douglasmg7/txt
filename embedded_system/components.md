## Shunt resistor
A shunt resistor is used to measure electric current, alternating or direct. This is done by measuring the voltage drop across the resistor.
Is a device that creates a low-resistence path for electric current, to allow it to pass around another point in the circuit.
The origin of the term is the verb 'to shunt' meaning to turn away or follow a different path.
