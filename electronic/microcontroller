ATmega168

CPU

Flash memory (16k)
    Store compiled code.
    Nonvolatile.

RAM or SRAM (RAM == DRAM)
    Store temporary variables.
    Volatile.

EEPROM
    Slow to write.
    There is not to much or it.
    Nonvolatile.

Clocks
   There are multiple clocks that are all derivated from the same commom timebase.
   Internal RC oscillator as the master clock source.
   It runs around 8 MHz.
   The CPU clock is then divided down from the master clock, and runs at 1 MHz by default.

Outputs
    Digital.
    Supply voltage level, VCC or GND.
    If the voltage applied externally to the pin is greater than half the supply voltage, the chip sets a bit in an internal variable to one.

Analog (doesn't have)
    PWM (pulse width modulation) 
        Switching the digital pin state vary rapidly between high and low voltages so the average voltage is somewhere in the middle.

Serial communications buit in
    USART - For communication with desktop computer, radio modems, and GPS units.
    SPI - Good for ultra-fast communication over very short distances with peripherals like memories, ADCs, and DACs.
    12C - Like a small network, allowing you to connect up to 127 different sensors to the same couple of wires.
