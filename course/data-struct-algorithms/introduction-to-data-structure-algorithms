Data structure
    A way to 'organize data' in a way that enables it to be processed in an efficient time

Some of common data structure (DS) are
    Array
    Linked List
    Stack
    Queue
    Tree
    Hashing
    Graph
    Etc...

Algorithms
    Is a set of rules to be followed to solve a problem

All these data structure have their own properites which is very unique in most of cases
So depending on the problem that we encounter we have to make a best choice of feature data structure

Types of DS
    Primiteve DS
        Bool
        Char
        Integer
        Float

    Non-primitive DS
        Physical DS
            Array
            Linked List

        Logical DS
            Stack
                Can be implemented using Array or Linked List
            Queue
                Can be implemented using Array or Linked List
            Tree
            Graph
