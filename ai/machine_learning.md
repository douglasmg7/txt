# ML - Machine Learning
To learn to do some task from data.
At a high-level it can be understood as appropriately recognizing and extracting patterns from the data.

## Supervised ML

### Classification problems
Try to predict a unknow category, called a class label based on a set of known, or observed, variables. 
There is binary classifiers and multiclass classifiers.

### Regression problems
Try to predict a unknown number based on a set of known, or observed, variables.

### RL - Reinforcement Learning
Trains software to make decisions to achieve the most optimal results. It mimics the trial-and-error learning process that humans use to achieve their goals. Software actions that work towards your goal are reinforced, while actions that detract from the goal are ignored.
