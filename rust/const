# Constant
# The type of the value must be annotated. 
# May be set only to a constant expression, not the result of a value that could only be computed at runtime.
# Rustâ€™s naming convention for constants is to use all uppercase with underscores between words.
# Const can be used in the global scope, and let can only be used in a function
