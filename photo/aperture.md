# Aperture (diafragma)

## f-stop
An f-stop, also known as an f-number, is a method of describing the size of the aperture, and the misunderstanding can arise because a smaller f-stop number means a larger aperture, hence more light getting into the camera.
A larger f-stop means a smaller aperture, meaning less light getting into the camera.

A larger f-stop means a smaller aperture, meaning less light getting into the camera.


## Depth of Field

Depth of field is basically using your aperture to control how much of the shot is in focus. The size of the aperture has a direct relationship to how much or little of your image appears sharp.

For instance, a large f-stop such as f/22 (which lets less light in than a lower f-stop) will give you an image with all the foreground and background in focus. Most landscape images are shot with a higher f-stop.

A small f-stop such as f/1.8, on the other hand, will isolate your subject from the background and blur everything that is not on that plane of focus. Think of close-up portraits where only the eyes are tack-sharp, and everything else gradually falls off into softness. A good example of that are the old-style Hollywood film star images from George Hurrell and Clarence Sinclair Bull. Food photography is another area where shallow depth of field is often used to separate food items from the background.

## Fast and Slow Lenses
If your lens has a maximum aperture of f/1.2 or f/1.4 like this lens, then it is considered to be a fast lens because you can use a faster shutter speed with them. If your lens has a maximum aperture of, say, f/4.0, like this lens, it canâ€™t let as much light in, so you would need to use a slower shutter speed to compensate in order to get correct exposure.

Fast lenses are also way, way more expensive than slow ones! They are very useful for shooting in low light situations, but you would only get the extra light f/1.2 could give at the expense of your wide depth of field, so they are not always the best choice, depending on what you are shooting.
