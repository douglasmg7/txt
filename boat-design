For a Double-Ender, the best compromise between Overall Length and Beam is expressed by the ratio LOA/Bm = 4/1.
This does not mean that the ratios 3½ to 1, or 4½ to 1, are no good.
It does mean that with the 3½ to 1 ratio the hull is a bit more stable and slower.
With the ratio 4½ to 1 the boat is faster, but also more tender.
It is the designer who makes the decision in the trade-off

The late John Gardner, in The Dory Book, makes that remark when he states,
“All Dories are developed from Double-Enders.
Their sheer line is part of a circle arc.”
In his book, on page 43, he calls that “a natural curve.”

“If you build a model first, you don’t have to buy the wood twice.”

If you put the widest beam at 55% of the length you will end up with a normal looking boat.
