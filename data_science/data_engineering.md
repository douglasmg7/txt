# Data engineering

## Data Engineering X Data Scientist
    1. Data collection                 -> Data Engineering
    2. Data Preparation                -> Data Engineering
    3. Exploration & visualization     -> Data Scientist
    4. Experimentation & Prediction    -> Data Scientist

## Pipeline

### ETL (Popular framework for designing data pipelines)
    * Extrac data
    * Transform extracted data
    * Load transformed data to another database

### Data pipeline
    * Move data from one system to another
    * May flow ETL
    * Date may not be transformed
    * Date may be directly loaded in applications

## Data type
    * Structured (SQL)
    * Semi-structured (NoSQL, JSON, YAML)
    * Unstructured (Sound, image, text)

## Data engineering -> database -> Data scientists

## Storing

### Data lake
    * Store all collected raw data
    * Data unprecessed
    * Messie data
    * Can be petabytes (1 million GBs)
    * Store all data type (structure)
    * Cost effective
    * Difficult to analyze
    * Requires an up-to-date data catalog

### Data warehouse
    * Specific data for specific use
    * Relatively small
    * Mainly structured data
    * More costly to update
