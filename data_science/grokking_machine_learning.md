# Grokking Machine Learning

### Artificial Inteligence - AI
In general, any time we see a computer solving a problem by itself.
In many cases, a computer makes these decisions by mimicking the ways a human makes decisions.
In other cases, they may mimic evolutionary processes, genetic processes, or physical processes.

### Machine Learning - ML
Machine learning is similar to artificial intelligence, and often their definitions are confused.
ML is a part of artificial intelligence, and we define it as follows:
The set of all tasks in which a computer can make decisions based on data.

### Deep Learning - DL
The field of machine learning that uses neural networks.
Deep learning is arguably the most used type of machine learning because it works really well.
If we are looking at any of the cutting-edge applications, such as image recognition, text generation, playing Go, or self-driving cars, very likely we are looking at deep learning in some way or another.

### How do human think?
Remember -> formulate -> predict

### Computer
Remember - Look at huge table data.
Formulate - Create models by going through many rules and formulas, and check which model fits the data best.
Predict - Use the model to make predictions about future data.

### Model
Representation of reality using a set of rules that mimic the existing data as closely as possible.

### Algorithm
The process that we used to build the model.

In short, a model is what we use to make predictions, and an algorithm is what we use to build the model.

### Feature 
Any property or characteristic of the data that the model can use to make predictions.

### The main three families of machine learning models
• Supervised learning - is the most natural one to start learning and arguably the most used right now.
• Unsupervised learning.
• Reinforcement learning.
